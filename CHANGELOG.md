# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project aims to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Browser e2e suite (Playwright) in `tests/e2e-ui/` — `pnpm test:e2e:ui`. Deterministic
  Chromium specs for login, chat (LLM stubbed), project create, and user create/delete.
- `data-testid` anchors on the login / chat / projects / users surfaces and `role="dialog"`
  on `<Dialog>` / `<ConfirmDialog>` for stable test/automation locators.
- Open-source project files: `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, issue & pull-request templates, this
  changelog.

### Fixed

- `DELETE /api/admin/users/:id` returned 500 on a successful delete. `users.delete` checked
  `result.rowCount`, which the postgres-js driver does not populate; switched to the
  codebase-standard `.returning()` + length check.

## [0.1.0]

- Initial release.
